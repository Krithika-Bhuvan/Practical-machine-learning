## Executive Summary
The data is from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. The goal was to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. 

## Methods
In this report, we used cross validation and evaluated three different predition methods on the training set and chose the model that gave the highest accuracy as the "best model". This model was then applied one time on the test dataset to get the final class prediction. 

## Results
After comparing three methods - PCA with SVM, Random Forest, and GLM Net, I found that the Random Forest model gave the highest accuracy and chose that as the best model.
